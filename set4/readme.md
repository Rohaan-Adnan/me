Learnt how to use the requests library to make HTTP requests to an API and retrieve data. It also demonstrates data manipulation, error handling, and string operations in Python

The concepts learnt where making HTTP requests using requests, parsing JSON data, iteration with conditionals, accessing nested data, and storing and returning data.

 The task involved analysing a G-code file, counting the occurrences of a specific command ("M10 P1") that turns the laser on/off, and storing the count in an output file. Key concepts learned include file handling, string manipulation, looping, type casting, and file system modifications.
